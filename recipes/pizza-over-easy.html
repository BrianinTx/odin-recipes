        <h1>Pizza Over Easy</h1>
        <img src="file:///home/brian/repos/odin-recipes/img/pizza-over-easy.JPG">
        <p>This recipe answers the age old question, "What do I do with left-over pizza?". Apparently, "Eat it dummy" is way too simple for our
            complex times. I invented this culinary monstosity on my honeymoon. Twenty plus years later, we are still married. Must be love.

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 piece of leftover pizza</li>
            <li>2 Large eggs</li>
            <li>Garlic salt</li>
            <li>Left-over red paper flakes. You didn't throw those packets away did you?</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Preparation</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>If the pizza is thin crust, cut the back of the crust off so that the pizza will lie flat.</li>
            <li>Heat a non-stick or lightly oiled cast iron skillet over medium heat.</li>
            <li>Crack one egg into the skillet and lightly season with garlic salt and red pepper</li>
            <li>Place pizza, face-down on top of the egg. Cook for about one minute. The egg will take longer to cook because of the pizza.</li>
            <li>Remove pizza from skillet and set aside.</li>
            <li>Crack next egg into skillet and season as before.</li>
            <li>Place pizza face-up on top of egg. Cook for about one minute.</li>
            <li>Serve hot with you favorite breakfast beverage.</li>
        </ol>
