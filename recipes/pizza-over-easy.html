        <h1>Pizza Over Easy</h1>
        <img src="../img/pizza-over-easy.JPG" alt="Pizza over easy.">
        <p>This recipe answers the age-old question, "What do I do with leftover pizza?". Apparently, "Eat it, dummy." is way too simple for our
            complex times. I invented this culinary monstrosity on my honeymoon. Twenty-plus years later, we are still married. Must be love.
        </p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 slice of leftover pizza</li>
            <li>2 Large eggs</li>
            <li>Garlic salt</li>
            <li>Leftover red paper flakes. You didn't throw those packets away did you?</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Preparation</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>If the pizza is thin crust, cut off the back of the crust so that the pizza slice will lie flat.</li>
            <li>Heat a non-stick or lightly oiled cast iron skillet over medium heat.</li>
            <li>Crack one egg into the skillet and lightly season with garlic salt and red pepper</li>
            <li>Place the pizza slice, face down on top of the egg. Cook for about one minute. The egg will take longer to cook because of the pizza.</li>
            <li>Remove the pizza slice from the skillet and set it aside.</li>
            <li>Crack the other egg into the skillet, and season as before.</li>
            <li>Place the pizza slice, face up, on top of the egg. Cook for about one minute.</li>
            <li>Serve it hot with you favorite breakfast beverage.</li>
        </ol>
