        <p>If you are an old grill hand, you have probably used something like this before. This is my personal version.
           This is a great rub for beef, pork, and chicken. Rub it generously into brisket and ribs. Mix with ground beef
           for hamburgers. Rub it on and under the skin for poultry. I like to add a teaspoon to a bowl of canned chili to
           liven it up. If you have time, season your meat and place it in the refrigerator overnight to let the flavors
           really blend in.
